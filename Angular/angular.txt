popular open source JS 
TS framework developed by Google
Allows you to build dynamic single page applications with ease.
powerful features & robust architecture.


1.Two way data binding
2.Dependency injection(Enhanced)
3.Component based architecture
4.more streamlined & efficient development
5.Standalone components
6.Manage data using singals
7.Excellent tooling support
8.Seamless integration with other libraries
9.Vibrant community of developerd


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


Angular CLI is a command - line interface tool 
which is used to intialize, develop, scaffold &
maintain Anguular applications
directly from the command shell
 
1. Running the development server
2. Deploying the application
3. secure binding of data
4. Instant support & good data security
5. Add additional features
6. Test the angular application 

---------------------------------node cmd---------------------------
1. NOde.js(use of npm):: Lightweight webserver to host the angular applications locally in ur system 

node -v:: current version

nvm alias default node
nvm use default 

----------------------------------vscode--------------------------------------
npm i -g @angular/cli
ng v


(ng stands for angular cli )

------------------------------------angular cmd-----------------------------

ng new applicationmname 
ng serve
ng serve -o


---------
ng g c componentname


-------[tips]
spread operator [...this.items]::

{{items.join(",")}}:: using , we can seperate an array
--------------------------------------Theory--------------------------------



Node_modules: contains all the third party libraries on which the angular application depends upon

public : favicon.ico:  officail angular icon

app: component file, config file, route file

main .server.ts: its the key component for bootstrapping the angular application on the server side
main.ts : boostrapping the aa in the browser
style.css: global styling

.editorconfig: maintain consistent coding style , when multiple develoers are working on the same project, same formatting rules

.gitignore: ensure that certain files or folders remain hidden from git repo like node _ module foder
which contains fles and is not needed as a part of the code repo 

angular.json : 

node.js:: its a crucial file as it sets up and configure the node.js server that will serve angular application.
ensures rhat the angular application can be render pages on the server before sending them to the client enhancing performance 


spec.ts :: for testing 
route.ts::

------------------------------------------------angular 19 --------------------
1. standalone component 

	 replaced structuere to @Component({
selector:'app-root',
templateUrl:''
styleUrl:''
imports:[],
})

By default every component in Angular is a standalone component.
if u dont want thwn @Component({standalone:false})


2. Improved Dependency Injection

inject():: without using constructors,  we can inject ,

earlier:constructor(private http : HttpClient){}
now: private http= inject(HttpClient);

3. optimized preloading 

4. improved token injection:
such as usevalue , useFactory

@Conmponet({useValue:{}})




-----------------[component]
is a basic building block of an Angular aplication 

root component : app-----> eventually branch out to other component 



1. import component decorator from angular/core 

--------------[decorator]
A function which modifies a class or property definition  

eg: @Component({}) :: which is component decorator:: @DirectiveDecorator

[DirectiveDecorator]
whenever Angular renders tge directive, it changes the DOM according to the instructions given by the directive 
provide meta data
meta data provides information on what to do with the class



------------------------------
1.	selector:'app-root':: HTML tag
2.	standalone: true:: tandalone components can be used without being declared in an NgModule & is part of Angular
	effort to simplify the component model 

3.	imports:[]:: is generally used for specifiying the component or any other dependency names which will be used by the current component 
			without specifiying the component name sinside the imports array  we cannot use them inside the current component 


--------------------------------------[INTERPOLATION   {{}} ]

{{}}:: delimiters

is a technique used to bind data from component class to the view template 

value = null or undfined
{{value}}:: empty string

{{"hai"+value}}
{{6+2}}
{{isActive? 'active':'Inactive'}}

use:: concat strings or bind string values 

--------------------------------[PROPERTYBINDING [] ]

[propertname]="variablename"

we can bind:: class, id, src, href any target propert ::: i.e we assign value 


use: to toggle button feature,set path programmaticaly, share values between 
the components

------------------------------eventBinding ()--------------------------
in js : onClick
in angular: click 


(click)="function("value if any ")"


In eventBinding , data is sent from the DOM to the component that is why its is a one way binding 
Whereas in property binding, we send the data from the component to the DOM or view 
-------------------------------mouseEvent------------------------

click
dbclick
mouseover
mousedown
drag
mouseleave
mouseup
dragover

-----------------------------keyboard--------------------------

(keypress) event = (keydown) event + (keyup) event 

keypress.eneter

keydown,keyup,select,focus,input,cut,copy,paste,blur

------------------------------------EVENT OBJECT-----------------------------
The evenet object ($event) is a reserved keyword to handle the events
 in angular & contains a lot of information when the event is raised


<input type ="" (keypress/mouse/.......)="function($event)" />
when the component or directive raises the evenet the event handler
executes the template statement i.e., the function().


[e:any:: Accepts any type of argument without any restrictios.]

-----------------------
e.target.value :: gets the values after the keypress gets fired 

--------------------------------[]------------------------------------------
The $event object in angular represents the DOM evnt object 
that is passed to an event handler when an evem=nt is triggede

.preventDefault():: prevents the default behaviour


accessinig input value: e.target.value

preventing default action:e.preventDefault()

stopping event propagation: e.stopPropagation()

Tracking mouse position: trackMouse(e:mouseEvent){
this.mouseX= event.clientX;
this.mouseY= e.clientY;
}


handling key events:<input type ="" (keypress/mouse/.......)="function($event)" />


Does not implicite passing of $event object only with events only 





-------------------------------------------------
(keydown.shift.y)-"isShift()":: called as key event binding 

OR

isShift(e:any){
if(e.shiftKey&& e.key=='y'){
c.l('shift key ')}
}

-------------------------------------focusing----------------------------

Elements like <input>, <button>, <a> are focusable by default.

But elements like <div>, <span>, <p> are not focusable by default.

If an element isn't focusable, it won’t receive keyboard events like keydown, keyup, or keypre

tabindex="0"




-------------------------------------[(ngModel)] two way binding ---------------------------------------

sharing the data or synchronization between the model the component class
and the view i.e the HTML template 

[()]:: banana in the box:: combination of both property and eventbinding

steps
-----

1. FormsModule
		controls& handle:: input,select.textarea.other form controls

		primarily used for template-driven forms,its role extends beyond just enabling two-way binding
		This module can be used in many areas.	

2. import it 




dis:: TightCoupling between componnet data model and the UI

	performance issue 


[(ngModel)] is meant for form controls like:

<input>

<select>

<textarea>

	------------------------------------------------------------- 
 get totalPrice(): number {
    return this.quantity * this.price;
  }

:: get use helps in calling the method without paranthesis

-----------------------------DIRECTIVE-------------------------------------


1. One of the most important & core features in angular
2. A set of classes used for adding some additional behaviour to the elements/the components of the 
	angular application

eg:..., Adding/REmoving an element from the DOM.


					[TYPES]
				-----------------------

1. STRUCTURAL DIRECTIVES
	Responsible for shaping & reshaping the DOM structure by handling 
	tasks like adding , removing & manipulating the elements

*ngIf, *ngFor,*ngSwitch

2. Attribute directives
	responsible for changing the behaviour or appearance of HTML 
	elements

ngClass,ngStyle,ngModel

3.Component directives
	responsible for controlling the rendering the angular components 
	in the template 

4.Custom directives
	Not  standard directives as they are created by the user ,
	for difing a new behaviour of the elements or extending some
	 functionality.



--------------------------------[STRUCTURAL DIRECTIVES]------------------
		prefixed by *
      ADDING/REMOVING THE ELEMENT FROM THE DOM
	import:commonModule
```````````````````````````````[*ngIf	]````````````````````````````````````````

<h1 *ngIf="num>o"> DISPLAY  {{num}}</h1>


using it rather than css will improve PERFORMANCE as its not rendered by angular 


The *ngIf is a seperate directive written itself in angular using the @Directive
The @if is a part of the template engine itself like the interpolation sysntax 
{{variable}} 




```````````````````````````````````````````````[*ngFor  OF,INDEX,TRACKBY]```````````````````````````
*ngFor="let value of fullstack"

value: variable name 
of
fullstack: perform an iteration on every item 


of ::
index as i :: used onbly with ngFor directives


[by default angular-rerender the entire list whenever the data in the array changes, even if only a single item has changed
	This can be inefficient for large lists. So the [track by] function
	helps, angulr identify each item uniquely, so only the affected items are re-rendered basically optimizing the performance 
]

When you use trackBy, Angular knows which items are being reused or updated. This helps it avoid unnecessary re-renders for items that haven't changed. This optimization ensures that the properties (name, id) of the items can be accessed immediately without the unnecessary overhead of full re-rendering.

However, without trackBy, Angular would not be as efficient in handling list changes, and in some cases, it might create new DOM elements, causing delays or issues in property availability.

``````````````````````````````````````````````[ngSwitch]`````````````````````````````````````````````
div [ngSwitch]="value"

p *ngSwitchCase ="value1".....

p *ngSwitchDefault.....


Used to conditionally render the view


-----------@switch

@switch(){
@case(){}
.
.
.

.
@default(){}

 }


----------------------------[ATTERIBUTE DIRECTIVE]-----------------------------------------------

ASSIGNING css style , css class to element 

[ngClass="value"]   or [ngClass="'value'"] :: for this metion the value with 
same value in ts 

for objects

<p [ngClass]="{'updateStyle':true},....">
1. import value in ts
	value : any ='value'


-----------------------[ngStyle:::For inline styling ]-----------

[ngStyle]="{key:'value'}"
[ngStyle]="{'property':getColor()}"



------------------------------[ng-container]----------------
angular tag to group the elements

dont get rendederd in DOM as it is an ANgular directive and not an actual
html tag

----------------------------------[ng-Template]----------
directive is a structural directives used for rendering templates dynamically inside
the same or different components.



-------------------------------[ng-template]-------------------------
diective is used to define a block of code that can be reused or rendered multiple
times inside the document 

[reference variable is required ]


-----------------------------------[*ngtemplateOutlet]----------


we need conditions to turn on the ng template 
but by ngTemplateOutlet  wecan do it to turn on ng template

<ng-template #show let-msg="showMessage">
<p>{{msg}}<>
<ng-container *ngTemplateOutlet="show" context:{showMessage:'hehhe'}>


context:{key:value}:: context is an optional parameter
		which passes an object to the template 

-------------------------------[$implicit]--------------------

implicit property i.e BYDEFAULT set it as property


<ng-template #show let-person>
<p>{{person.name}}<>
<ng-container *ngTemplateOutlet="show" context:{$implicit:showdetails}>





----------------------------[component lifecycle]-------------

when a omponent is created in angular it goes through different
 lifecyle phases like from being created to being destroyed 



1. when class is created the construtor method is alled automatially

AFTER CONSTRUCTION THE COMPONENT GOES THROUGH A SERIES OF LIFE CYCLE PHASES, LIKE

A	Constructor
1	ngOnChanges
2	ngOnInit
3	ngDoCheck 
4	ngAfterContentInit
5	ngAfterContentChecked 
6	ngAfterViewInit 
7	ngAfterViewChecked
8	ngDestroy


[ngOnInit]:: implement OnInit
		::called automatically when componet is created 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[ngOnChanges]: hook is called everytime whenever there isa a change detected 
		in input properties of the componenet.
---html
<app-test [inputValue]='inputValue'></>




----ts
	....implemets OnChanges
@Input() inputValue:string='';:: used for passsing the value from the parent 
component to the child component.
ngOnChanges(changes:simpleChanges):void	{
}

<app-life-cycle [inputValue]="inputValuefromApp"></app-life-cycle>

	





Changes detected: ObjectinputValue: SimpleChangecurrentValue: "HELLO LIFE CYCLE"firstChange: truepreviousValue: undefined[[Prototype]]: Object[[Prototype]]: Objectconstructor: ƒ Object()hasOwnProperty: ƒ hasOwnProperty()isPrototypeOf: ƒ isPrototypeOf()propertyIsEnumerable: ƒ propertyIsEnumerable()toLocaleString: ƒ toLocaleString()toString: ƒ ()valueOf: ƒ valueOf()__defineGetter__: ƒ __defineGetter__()__defineSetter__: ƒ __defineSetter__()__lookupGetter__: ƒ __lookupGetter__()__lookupSetter__: ƒ __lookupSetter__()__proto__: (...)get __proto__: ƒ __proto__()set __proto__: ƒ __proto__()
core.mjs:20782 Angular is running in development mode.





[1. when the input data is changed 
2. cahnged info is passed to the simpleChanges interface.
3. Change reflected in the output 
TO HANDLE INPUT CHANGES like reading the values & updating the fields, the ngOnChanges hook comes handy!!

@Input()

]


[DIFFERENCE WITH NGONINIT]
The ngOnChnges() hook is called whenever an input property changes,
even before the component is intiaized

While ngOnInit() hook is called only once, after the first change 
detection cycle, when the component is intialized

---------------------breif  -------------
ngOnChanges(changes:SimpleChanges){
}

		[SIMPLE CHANGES]

key:value
previousValue:
currentValue:
firstChange:




changes['property']:: allows to keep track of any change in input value property of app component

changes['property'].prevoiusValue:: returns the value which was previously entered in the input
changes['property'].currentValue:: returns teh current value entered in the input 

firstChange :: returns true if pv and cv are same 

s


doesnot store the history of changes between detection cycle ::: only most recent
 changes is detected
-------------------------------------[ngOnInit()]----------------------------------------	
called only once during the component lifecycyle when a component is inttialized

called after ngOnChanges()
	when there is no template-bound inputs,
the ngOnInit() call is made fist.


whenever the ngOnit() call is made by angular -it creates that 
angular is done creating the component interbnally and whatever initialization
 code is written inside the ngOnInit() hook is executed at that moment 


best practice to use the upadation in ngOnInit():: as it waits till the component is rendered
1. NgOnINit() is defenitly a preferred place to fetch data from api
2. is ready to handle asynchronous data & thet all necessary services 
	are properly injected & available
3. No multiple calling 

[if we try to access input properties in the cobstructor
they will be undefined because the input bindings are not yet
 intialized when the constructor is called]


--------------------------------------[ngDoCheck()]

. used for custom change detection
. implement our own change detection algorith for the given componenet



1. Use the ngOnChanges() to check the limitations.
2. Refactor it using the ngDOCheck()
3. unlike ngOnChanges it checks non input properties


never use the ngOnChanges() & ngDoCheck() hooks together in the same componnet
They are not intended to be implemented together inside the same compoenent as 
it causes unwanted behaviour & increases the code complexity

[use]
1. watching deep changes inmn nested object
2. any chanegs in 3rd party library
3. for mutual state management 



--------------------------------[ngAfterContentInit()]
lifecycle hook is invoked whever there is some content projected
into the component.

content projected:: with @ input we cant give html or css so with the help
of ng-content we hgive

1. called only once throughout the components lifecycle


@ViewChild()
@ContentChild()

-------------------------------------[ngAfterContentChecked()]----------------------------------------


checks for the content of the component on every change detection cycle

this hook will get invoked each time the content of the component is changed after being projected



----------------------------------------[ngAfterViewInit()]

is called when the angular finishes the intialization of the view in the DOM



after angular has fully initialized the view the ng AFterViewInit() gets called .Mostly this hook involves DOM
related tasks including the child componnets view


VIEW LOADS AFTER THE CONTENT

called after the angular has fully initialized the componnets view or any 
child views which are basically the related template files.


delay should be give to avoid error in second stage checking 

--------------------------------------------[ngAfterViewChecked()]
angular fires the ngAfterViewChecked() hook after checking the componnet view and the child views



------------------------------------[ngDestroy]
hook is called only once durring the compoenets lifecycle right brfore the component
gets destroyed

Any cleanup code for the componenet should be written inside this hook 

LIKE : removcal of local storage
stop timer
tak that  prevent teh memory leaks


THE ng onDEstroy() is not called when the user refreshes the page or closes the 
browser






------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------[DECORATOR]

PRefixed with  :@
1. Used to pass the information
2. A function with some code logic i.e meta data



like springbooot autowired

with a decotrator - we are passing information to the component, class or a function on how they 
should be processed instantiated and used at runtime




[types]

1.class decorator

@NgModule
@Component
@Injectable
@Directive
@Pipe

2. Method Decorators
@HostListener

3.Parameter Decorators
@Inject

@Optional
@Host

4. Property Decorators
@Input

@HostBinding
@ContentChild
@ViewChild
@ViewChildren




------------------------------------[CalssDecorator]------------------------------------------

		[@NgMOdule]
@NGModule : n0o longer after 17 as angular provide standalone by default 
: no need to create an extra set of modules

but helpfull for : Dependency injection
		: Service provider
		:lazy loading 


Basically an object with some properties which takes an array as value 
@NgModule({.....})

1. declaration:[]:Here we put all the components defined inside the project
		export is the keyword used to make the class globally available for use


2. imports:[BrowserModule,AppRoutingModule]: contains the necessary services which are imported to launch & run the
		 application inside the browser

3. providers:[]:: here we provides the service or guard files known as dependencies,
		injected into the component
4. bootstrap:[AppComponent]::Here we give the compoenent name to be loaded first
		inside the browser-i.e..,the entry point
		



		[@Component]

decorator marks the class as an angular component & provides necessary metadata which
 determines how the componenet should be processed during runtime.
Selector:''
standalone: true,::It doesnt need to be declared in an @NgModule() & can directly import 
		dependencies
imports:[]
templateUrl:
styleUrl:[]
template:''
style:''
animation:[]
directives:[]
pipes:[]


----------------------[PropertyDecorators]
-----------@Input     parent to child    [child]='parent'
::decorator marks the property as input property so that it can receive 
	the data from the parent component


::alias

@Input('parentMessage') receiveMessage:string='';



arrayofOBJeCT:::{id:number;.......}[]:: type safe 

-------------@Output   child to parent   (child)='parent($event)'

when the property is decorated with @Output decorator that property raises
an event to notify the parent about the change

@Output() myEvent = new EventEmitter()
emitEvent(){this.myEvemt.emit('EVENT EMITTED FROM CHILD')}

------------------------------------@ViewChild

this decorator is used to get the reference of the DOM element in the component 

it renders a tree as soon as an application bootstraps & each componenet represents a view known as view reference(ViewRef)

Each component instance holds a View reference

Helps to perform que5ry operations on the view & any change in the DOm will reflect in it 


@ViewChild(ChildComponent) cc?:ChildComponent;:::: ? -> This pproperty has no value at the initial stage but be assigned later

acessing child method::: this.cc?.incrCounter();

::: for accessing a butn we give refference and is passed to viewchild :: and type as 
ElementRef:-> A class that is used whenever we want to deal with the elements of DOM as
 this class acts as a wrapper around the native elements of DOM::<HTMLButtonButtonElement>


[when dealing with DOM manipulationb it is always a better prctice to execute such code
inside the ngAfterViewInit() hook]

ngAfterViewINit() is a lifecycle hook in agular that is commonly used with @ViewChild

ngAfterViewInit():void{
if(this.btnRef?.nativeElemenet){
this.btnRef.nativeElement.innerHtml=''counter++';}}::THE PROPERTY THAT IS PROVIDED BY THE ELEMENTREF CLASS TO TARGET THE ELEMENT OF DOM 


-------------------------------------[@ContentChild]



instead of getting the components DOM element we get the reference of the content projected 
into the components view

1. for Content projection 
2. make use of the ngAfterContentInit()


ngAfterContentInit():void{
const content= this.paraRef?.nativeElement;
content.style.font='italic'}


-------------------------------------[@HostBinding]


The @HostBinding decorator is used for binding the properties on element/component/class 
with the help of custom directive 

HB allows binding the property on the host element


ng g d directiveName --skip-tests

inside directive:::{

@HostBinding('style.background') bgcolor ='#f2aaa4cf';
}




The reference variable bgcolor are used to assign the value to the properties explicitly


-----------------------------------------[METHOD DECORATOR]
A method decorator is very similar to property decorator, but is used for the methods 
instead as it allows to decorate specific methods within the given cimponent class


@HostListner

[
1. ?: string
This means optional property.
2. !: string
This is the definite assignment assertion.
]




-----------------------------------[Parameter decorators]
The arameter decorators are used to decorate the parameters and they are mainly applied to a constructor parameter to
inject or provide additional metadata resources inside the application

called as dependency injection 
like service injection 





-----------------------------------[PIPELINE]------------------------------
| : used when we are uncertain of what value to intialize with a property

previousValue:string|undefined;


Pipes are the template binding feature that allowssome transformation on the data before 
displaying them 


The oreder of pipe is considered fif


|uppercase,|lowercase, async,filter,map,date,slice,oredrBy,,percentage,currency,join,json 
,titlecase




|date:"dd-mm-yyyy"   or /   
mm:02
mmm:sep
mmmm:septemper

[slice]

|slice:0:3
from 0 to 3 give 
-value to reach end by subracting from last position 

slice:-11
end be : 0  to -11 position 

with array same 
slice:1 to retrevie that element from array
dlice -1: to retreive last elemnet
n n 

|currency:'USD'

TIP 1:TYPE CAST BETTER 

product:{name:string;imageUrl:string}[]=[{}]


---------------------------[custom pipe]
ng g pipe pipename

* @Pipe({})

* transform():: maijn method and it takes one argument which 
	        needede to be transformed.

-----------------------------------------
pure pipe:transforsm data whenever it detects the change in input value
or process the input and returns values without any side effects
: used to gat called only on the input value changes
cons: never modify the input array

 impure pipe:transforms the data even if the input data hasnt changed
:change of input value for updating the view   2 times
----------------------------------------------------------------------




					ADVANCED
					--------
	
--------------------------------------[Routing]
refers to navigating between diffenet componenet
. all the routing is carried out by the router services, which 
is responsible for navigating between components

app.route.ts:

[{path:'',component: }]
path,component,loadComponent,reirectTo,pathMatch,children....

PROVIDED BY  ROUTERMODULE

<router-outlet>: without this angular wouldnt know where to inject the content 
for the current route, meaning no components would be rendered for navigation 

<a routerLink="./">: router Link is an attribute directive that allows to add behaviour to an existig 
element by changing its attribute


traditional mapping : static routing enables mapping between the URL and a specific component.
eg: {p:'',c:}
which are not changed untill we change it in manually 
Dynamic routing is acheived by passsing parameters to the routes
eg:{p:'/employee/:empname',c:}
<a href="#" [routerLink]="['/employee',emp.empname]">



-----------------------------[WILDCARD ROUTING ]

   ** :: for allll the route that are not configured
its a specilal route the router will select this route if the requested url soent match

{p:'**',component:pageNoTFound}


----------------------------[redirect to:]
{path:'', redirectTo:'shirts',pathMatch:"full"}
pathmatch : how to match the path :
full: match the whole route path
prefox: matches the URL if it starts with the route s path  



---------------[activated route]
import it in the class

Used to get the information about the currently activated route.
provides access to various properties and parameters 


route : {path:'employee/:id',component:};

employee{

id:strijng='';

constructor(private route:ActivatetedRoute ){

const params= this.route.snapshot.param;
this.id = param['id'];

}

is a property of activatedRoute that cptures a static, one-time view of the routes parameters,
query parameters,data and fragment at the moment the route was activated



 -----------------------------------------------------[queryParameter] 
?..&...

part of get Http call method

route.queryParams.subscribe((params)=>{
this.id=params['id']
this.name=params['name'];
})



@for(emp of employee; tarck $index){

a href='' [routerLink]="['/employee']"
[queryParams]
}



routerLink: its a directive
queryParams: property

queryParams: property of Activated Route class
an observable property

subscribe: Used to continously monitor the query parametersin the 
URL and update the component when they change.

The query parameters are very usful when we want to fetch or pass the information
through a URL and further modify the behaviour 
of the receiveing component

-------------------------------------[Navigate()]
The navigate() method is used to programmatically navigate to diffecnt routes in the 
application.

Its a part of the Router service, which handles client- side routing & allows 
to dynamically control


in constructor use Router : to use navigate to method  with queryparam : as object 


navigateToDetail(empID:number,empName:string){this.router.navigate(['/employee-detail'],{queryParams:{id:empId,name:empName},}); }

vs
Routuing

<a [routerLink]="['/employee-detail']" [queryParams]="{id:employee.id,name:employee.name}">


how to navigate&clear any existing query parameters
this.router.navigate(['/employee-detail'],{queryparams:{},});

----------------------------------------------------------------------------


-----------------------[Service]

used to perform tasks such as fetching data from serever , handling data manipulation


[ng g s dependecies/ employee]:: create service inside depencies folder  with namee employee


common way to inject is constructor injection 


Angular dependecy injection system automatically 
resolves the dependencies and provides an instance of the service
when the component is instantiated.


--------------------[@Injectable]---------

The angular dependency injection mechanism automatically identifies that
 class as an injectable class and allow that class to be injected in
different components or class.
It indicates that a component , class , pipe or NgModule has a dependency on a 
service





when we provide a service at the root level, Angular creates a single , shared instance
of the given service & injects it into any class that asks for it , kniow as 
sinngleton service


levels:[ MOdule level]

@NgModule({
providers:[] 
}) 


, service level
@Injectable({providedIn:''})

 , component level 

@Component({
providers:[]
})



@Component({
providers:[specify the needed serviec ethat is not even in root level]

})

providers are used for implementing dependency injection. They are responsible for registring and confuguring
the dependencies that component sand services require.







--------------------------[inject()]
The inject function helps in cutting constructor
.. is often yuused in standalone components or functional service
 where constructor might not be a practical approah 


Also it is very helpful in defer loading i.e lazy loading of the service 
wntil its actually needed. 

-----------------------------------[InjectingTokens]
it act as a key to  uniquely identify  provider  i.e class   at runtime



Token types: Type token, string token, Injection token object


//type token 
in @ componnet providers:[
{provide:  tokenName, useClass:serviceclsssname  },.....
]


provider with last is selected if  tokenName is same 

public logger = inject( tokenName);
ngOnInit():void{ this.logger.log();}
provide:the Dependency Injection system needs a key to locate the provider.
useClass: Tells teh angular DI to instantiate the provided class when the dependecy i sinjected

useClass, useExisting,useFactory, useValue



//STRING TOKEN 

in @ componnet providers:[
{provide:  'tokenName', useClass:serviceclsssname  },.....
]

when we want to inject string token we have to use constructor()

constructor(@Inject('tokenName') private name:serviceclsssname )



//Injection token 

when we want to provide a value or configuration that is not based on a
class or type , then we use the injection token object.


The injectionToken is a speciakl token used in angular to inject values that are 
not classes, such as configuration OBJECT< PRIMITIVE VALUES or INTERFACE


1. create seperate ts file 
2. make variable export 

export const LOG_msg1= new InjectionToken<className>('');
import injection token as values instead of string 
is more preferable


//useValue

the useValue provider key provides a specific value to be used as dependency

 @ componnet providers:[
{provide:  'tokenName', useValue:'This is the String' },.....

]


constructor(@Inject('tn') public msg:string )


mostly used in ruyntime configurations such as base api address


//useExisting
useExisting: let us map one token to another like an alias.

to reuse the functionality in different component / service
